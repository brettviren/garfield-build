#+TITLE: Build GARFIELD with waf

The [[http://garfield.web.cern.ch/garfield/][Garfield simulation of gaseous detectors]] is built with an archaic set of tools, CERNLIB and a lot of added chaos.  This package tries to automate the mess.

* Installation

Get the [[./wscript]] file and do:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ waf configure build
#+END_EXAMPLE
