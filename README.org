#+TITLE: Build GARFIELD with waf

The [[http://garfield.web.cern.ch/garfield/][Garfield simulation of gaseous detectors]] is built with an archaic set of tools, CERNLIB and a lot of added chaos.  This package tries to automate the building.  It includes a copy of the GARFIELD FORTRAN files and will download the neBEM code.
